          Hi my name is Mario Garza I was born in Monterrey Mexico. When I was a kid I love to play outside and do all kind of sports my and my brother use to go for "dangerous bike rides" for hours up hill then sliding down fast way faster for our ages (lol) then finish it up refreshing ourselves on the swimming pool. At night we normally play some video games and have dinner with the family. Family is very important for all of us and we are use to spend time as family doing pretty much everything together including going to church and visiting more family like grandparents , normally on Sundays. 
           I went to UR (Universidad Regiomontana) college for half of my career then finish my International Business Administration degree in Austin Tx.

          everyday the work ethics like no other place - waking up really early ,
          being on time everyday , doing the right thing, look after me and my
